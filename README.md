# more-purchaseable-ships
A small plugin that, when added to the game Endless Sky, allows a player to buy the Enforcer and Saber spacecraft in certain shipyards. They aren't particularly good spacecraft, but they are very cute and provide a bit more versatility that without this plugin one can only get through capturing. Now it also adds the five modified Pirate ships to some shipyards, which otherwise mostly just languish in the game's files.
