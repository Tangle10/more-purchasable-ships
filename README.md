# more-purchaseable-ships
A small plugin that, when added to the game Endless Sky, allows a player to buy the Enforcer and Saber spacecraft in certain shipyards. They aren't particularly good spacecraft, but they are very cute and provide a bit more versatility that without this plugin one can only get through capturing.
